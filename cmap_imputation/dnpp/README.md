This folder provides scripts for running DNPP methods, as discussed in [Hodos et al., 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5753597/pdf/nihms921438.pdf) to impute CMAP data. It includes a Command-Line-Interface for interacting with the scripts, and a Python implementation of the DNPP algorithm.

The available scripts in this directory are:
- [dnpp.py](dnpp.py)
